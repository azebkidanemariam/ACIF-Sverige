            n John 14:6, Jesus said, “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No
            one can come to the Father except through me.” God sent his son,
            Jesus, to save us from our sins so we can live forever in heaven
            with him. The truth is, Jesus is the only way to live forever. And
            that is great news! Because God cannot lie, we know the only way to
            live a righteous life is to follow Jesus and obey him. John 17:17
            says, “Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is
            truth.” So, God only tells the truth, and his word, the Bible, is
            the truth. We know we can trust God and trust the Bible. Knowing
            God’s word helps us to be holy, set apart for serving God. In the
            very beginning of the Bible, there’s a story about someone who lies
            and cannot be trusted. Let’s think back to when God created the
            whole world. He made Adam and Eve and they lived in the beautiful
            Garden of Eden. They only had one rule they had to follow. Genesis
            2:16-17 says, “But the Lord God warned him, ‘You may freely eat the
