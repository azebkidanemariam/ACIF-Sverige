              <h1>Salvation</h1>
              <p className="flex-grow-1">
                While the word “salvation” has several meanings, in this writing
                it is used to express the act of saving the human soul from sin
                and its effect. The Holy Bible in: Ezek.18:4 says: “…the soul
                that sinnth, it shall die.” And in Rom 6:23 says: “For the wages
                of sin is death.” In Rom 3:12 it says: “They are all gone out of
                the way, they are together become unprofitable; …” and in verses
                22-23 says: “… for there is no difference: for all have sinned,
                and come short of the glory of God.” In Rom 5:12 also it says:
                “Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death
                by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have
                sinned”. Thus we believe that all human beings need salvation.
                The word of Lord Jesus Christ in Mat.16:26 says: “For what is a
                man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own
                soul?” or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?” What
                we can understand from this word is the primary and exceeding
                profit for man is the salvation of his/her soul. We believe that
                the human soul shall be saved by knowing and believing in the
                only God of salvation, repenting from all sins, being baptized
                in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sins,
                and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.

            <h1>Believing In The Only God Of Salvation</h1>
            <p>
              Believing In The Only God Of Salvation By understanding from the
              Scriptures, we believe that the God of salvation is only one.
              Supported by key Scriptures such as Deuteronomy 6:4, Isaiah
              43:10-11, 45:21-22, and Hosea 13:4, affirming the oneness of God
              and His exclusive role as the Savior. Our faith centers on the
              Lord Jesus Christ as the manifestation of this singular God in
              human form for the redemption of humanity, validated by passages
              like 1 Timothy 3:16 and Matthew 1:18-23. His sacrificial death,
              burial, and resurrection, outlined in 1 Corinthians 15:3-4, form
              the essence of our belief, highlighting the necessity of
              acknowledging this unique God for salvation.

            <h1>Repenting From All Sins</h1>
            <p>
              We believe that repenting from all sins is one of the essentials
              for salvation. Scriptural evidences for this are the following
              among many others. Luk. 13:1-5; “… And Jesus answering unto them,
              …I tell you, nay: but, except ye repent, ye shall all likewise
              perish.” Ezek. 18:30-32; “…Repent and turn your selves from all
              your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin. Cast away
              from you all your transgressions, whereby ye have transgressed;
              and make you a new heart and a new spirit: for why will ye die, O
              house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that
              dieth, saith the Lord God: where fore turn your selves, and live
              ye.” For repentance is one of the essentials for remission of sins
              and salvation, in Luke 24: 47 it says, “And that repentance and
              remission of sins should be preached in his name among all
              nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” To those whose hearts be pricked
              and believe the gospel of salvation, in Acts 2:38 it
              says,…Repent…” Therefore, we believe that repentance is one of the
              essentials for salvation.

            <h1>Baptism In The Name Of Jesus Christ</h1>
            <p>
              The commission by Jesus in Mark 16:15-16 emphasizes the universal
              spread of the gospel, the necessity of belief and baptism for
              salvation, and the consequences for disbelief. Scriptures in Mark
              16:16 and Acts 2:38 reinforce the importance of faith and baptism,
              highlighting their inseparable connection for salvation.
              Additionally, passages in Acts 4:12 and 1 Peter 3:20-21 underscore
              the significance of baptism as a means of spiritual rebirth,
              circumcision of the heart, and putting on Christ, as outlined in
              John 3:3-6, Colossians 2:11-12, and Galatians 3:27.

            <h1>Receiving The Gift Of The Holy Ghost</h1>
            <p>
              Jesus' teaching to Nicodemus in John 3 emphasizes the necessity of
              spiritual rebirth, signifying being 'born again' through water and
              the Spirit for entrance into God's kingdom. This spiritual rebirth
              addresses humanity's fallen nature, highlighting the need for
              regeneration for salvation. Titus 3:4-5 underscores God's mercy
              and the 'washing of regeneration' as crucial elements, leading us
              to believe that baptism in the name of Jesus Christ and receiving
              the Holy Ghost are pivotal for salvation, as emphasized in Acts
              2:38
