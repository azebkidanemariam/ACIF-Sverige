        <h3>Jesus Loves you</h3>
        <p>
          Jesus appeared several times to the disciples after He rose from the
          dead. This is a story of one of those times... Peter said to some of
          the other disciples, "I think I'm going to go fishing." The disciples
          that were there said, "Wait up, we'll go with you." It was getting
          dark outside but the disciples thought they would catch more fish at
          this time of day. They got into the boat and went out onto the water.
          They were out there for a long time. The time passed and it was almost
          morning but they still hadn't caught any fish. Jesus knew where His
          disciples were and went out to meet them. He was standing on shore,
          but the disciples didn't realize who He was. Jesus called to them,
          "Friends, haven't you caught any fish?" "No," they answered. So Jesus
          told them, "Throw your net on the other side of the boat and you will
          catch some." What happened next was amazing. The disciples, who had
          been fishing all night without catching anything, threw the net over
          to the other side and within minutes the net was overflowing with
          fish. One of the disciples realized who had been talking to them, "It
          is the Lord!" As soon as Peter heard this he jumped out of the boat to
          go to Jesus. (They weren't that far from shore). The other disciples
          stayed in the boat, and worked hard to tow all the fish to shore. When
          they met up with Jesus, there was a fire started with some bread lying
          close by. Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish you have caught
          and we'll have breakfast together." Peter helped the rest of the
          disciples get the fish out of the boat. There were so many fish and
          they were all so big and heavy that they all needed to lift together
          to get the fish out of the boat. Then they all sat together in front
          of the warm fire and Jesus took the bread and the fish and gave it to
          them. This was the third time Jesus had met with the disciples since
          He rose from the dead. After breakfast, Jesus asked Peter some
          important questions. He asked him, "Peter do you love me more than
          your parents and all your friends?" "Yes, Lord," he said, "You know
          that I love you." Again Jesus said, "Peter do you truly love me, no
          matter what?" He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
          Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?" Peter's feelings
          were hurt because Jesus kept asking him, but he replied, "Lord, you
          know the answer, you know that I love you." "Then follow me," Jesus
          said. *** Jesus loves you children's version Bible storyWe have
          learned that Jesus died on the cross because He loves us, no matter
          what bad things we do! Now we need to love Jesus no matter what. Here
          are some questions to think about: Would you still love/follow Jesus
          if... your mom or dad got very sick you had no friends you became
          blind, or couldn't walk anymore everything was going wrong you had to
          move away from all your friends you were poor and never got any
          Christmas present Some kids just like you have these problems, and
          much worse, and they still love Jesus! We need to remember that no
          matter what, Jesus loves us and will never ever stop loving us!
          Sometimes things happen that we don't understand, but Jesus knows
          everything and He will help us if we ask Him to.

        <h3>Abraham and Sara</h3>
        <p>
          Once there was a man named Abram. One day the Lord came to talk to
          Abram, and Abram asked, "Who will have all my things when I die". God
          promised Abram and his wife Sarai that one day they would be parents,
          even though they were old and had no children. God wasn't sure that
          Abram understood. So that night He took him outside, and said, "Do you
          see all the stars that are in the sky"? When Abram looked up, the
          whole night sky was full of stars, so many in fact that he would never
          be able to count them. Then God said, "That is how many children you
          will have". Quite a few years later when Abram was ninety-nine years
          old (older than even your grandparents) the Lord decided to change
          Abram's name to Abraham, which means "father of many." He also changed
          Sarai's name to Sarah. God told them again that they would be parents
          and that they would have a boy. This time Abraham laughed so hard he
          fell on his face! It was hard to believe that he and Sarah would have
          a child in their old age. One day three visitors came to Abraham's
          house. He hurried to meet them. "May I get you something to eat and
          drink?" Abraham asked. "Please come in and join us, and have a rest on
          the couch." The visitors agreed, so Abraham brought them some fresh
          bread, milk, and hamburgers. While the visitors were eating, they
          asked Abraham, "Where is your wife Sarah?" Abraham thought this was a
          little strange, but he replied, "She's in the other room". Then one of
          the men spoke and said, "I will come back to see you at this time next
          year, and Sarah will have a son." Now Sarah was listening behind the
          living room door. She started to laugh, but covered her mouth and
          laughed to herself because she didn't want to be heard. Then she said
          to herself, "How can I have a child, I'm almost one hundred years
          old?" Abraham and Sarah Bible children's storyLater when the visitors
          had left, Abraham and Sarah realized that the man who had told them
          this was indeed God. A year later Sarah did have a son. She and
          Abraham named him Isaac, which means "he laughs." They were very
          excited, and remembered to thank God for Isaac.

        <h3>David and goliath</h3>
        <p>
          Saul had been king, but he kept disobeying God so God asked Samuel to
          find a new king. God said to Samuel, "Go to Bethlehem and there is a
          man named Jesse with eight sons. One of them will be the next king."
          When Samuel first met the sons he automatically thought that the
          oldest son named Eliab would be the king that God had chosen. But the
          Lord said to Samuel, "Do not look at the way he looks or how big he
          is. Eliab is not the one I have chosen, the way he looks doesn't
          matter to me, I look at the heart." Jesse brought more of his sons to
          meet Samuel but none of them God had chosen either. Samuel asked
          Jesse, "Have I met all your sons?" Jesse replied, "I have one son left
          named David, he's the youngest, and he's out looking after the sheep.
          I will bring him here to meet you." As soon as Samuel saw him the Lord
          spoke to him and said, "He is the one." So Samuel anointed him with
          oil which was a special way of promising him that he would be the next
          king. And from that day on the power of the Lord was with David. David
          continued to take care of his father's sheep in the fields. When he
          didn't have much to do in the field he played instruments, and wrote
          songs and poems that you can find in the book of Psalms in your Bible.
          Meanwhile Saul was still king and he ruled people called Israelites.
          David and his family were Israelites too. The Israelites weren't
          getting along with people named the Philistines. The problem with the
          Philistines was that they had many giants living in their land. One of
          the strongest and biggest giants was named Goliath. He was over nine
          feet tall, which is taller than any person recorded in the Guinness
          Book of World Records. He would've had to bend way down to get through
          a regular door. Goliath was covered with armor to protect him and
          carried a big spear. Every morning and every evening for forty days he
          shouted to the Israelites in his big deep voice, "Hey, you guys! I
          dare you to find one man to fight me. If he can beat me we will become
          your servants, but if I win you will all become our servants." When
          Saul and all his men heard this they were very afraid. Three of these
          men were David's three oldest brothers. They were the only ones in
          David's family that could go fight because they were old enough. Now
          David's father Jesse heard about the giant and was worried for his
          sons. He called David out of the fields and asked him to take some
          food to his brothers and report back how they are doing. So David set
          off to visit his brothers. As he approached them he heard Goliath
          shouting his challenge like he did every morning. "Isn't someone going
          to stand up to this man?" David asked the men in the army. "Then I
          will fight this giant Philistine." One of the men overheard this and
          ran to Saul and told him what David said. Saul approached David and
          said, "You can't fight Goliath, you're only a boy and he has been
          fighting for many years." But David said to Saul, "I have had to fight
          lions and bears to protect my father's sheep. God helped keep me safe
          then and he will help keep me safe now." It was too bad that Saul the
          king wasn't trusting in God to help him, he didn't know what to do to
          beat Goliath. Then this young boy named David came and he knew in one
          day exactly what to do, and trusted that God would help him. That's
          why God loved David's heart and wanted him to be king. David and
          Goliath children's version Bible storySo Saul dressed David in heavy
          armor to protect him from Goliath but David took it off. It was so
          heavy he could hardly walk and he knew that God would keep him from
          harm. Instead David went to a stream nearby and found five smooth
          stones, put them in a pouch around his waist, and with his sling he
          went to Goliath. As David approached Goliath, Goliath looked at David
          and thought it was a joke. Goliath thought that he could easily beat
          David and it was funny that Saul would send a small boy to fight him.
          But David said to him without fear, "You fight with a sword and I come
          with God on my side and today everyone will know that there is one
          true God in this land." Goliath didn't care what David said and he
          moved closer to attack him, David ran quickly to meet him. Reaching
          into his pouch he pulled out a stone, put it into his slingshot and
          shot it at Goliath. The stone had hit him right between his eyes and
          suddenly Goliath started to lose his balance. He fell with a loud thud
          right on his face. David had done it, he beat the giant Philistine!
          When the rest of the Philistines saw this they ran away and David
          became a hero to all the people in Israel.

        <h3>Moses and the King</h3>
        <p>
          Moses was born well over a thousand years before Jesus arrived. When
          he was three months old he was put into a waterproof basket on the
          River Nile so that he would not be harmed. Moses was a Jew, and the
          king of Egypt wanted to stop the Jewish nation from growing too large
          and powerful – so he ordered all the Jewish baby boys to be killed!
          God kept Moses safe, and even arranged for the king’s daughter to find
          Moses on the river and bring him up as her own child. We can read
          about Moses in Acts 7:20-22, “At that time Moses was born – a
          beautiful child in God’s eyes. His parents cared for him at home for
          three months. When they had to abandon him, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted
          him and raised him as her own son. Moses was taught all the wisdom of
          the Egyptians, and he was powerful both in speech and action.” (New
          Living Translation) When Moses grew up he lived in the palace, but was
          very sad because his people (the Jews) were treated like slaves. He
          had to run away when he killed an Egyptian slave-master, and lived in
          the Midian desert for 40 years. This gave him plenty of time to get
          married and start a family! One day God spoke to him from a bush that
          seemed to be on fire... and sent him right back to Egypt to help set
          his people free. Unfortunately, the king did not want to let God’s
          people go, and so many terrible things (called ‘the 10 plagues’)
          happened to the Egyptian people before the king finally gave in. Moses
          led the Israelites, which is another name for the Jews, out into the
          desert – they were not slaves any more - they were free! Moses did not
          really want the job of setting his people free. He didn’t think he was
          a very good speaker, he was afraid of the king, and he generally
          worried about not being up to the challenge. God had to keep reminding
          him that He was more powerful than any king and would help Moses do
          the job he had asked him to do!

        <h3>Queen Esther</h3>
        <p>
          Long ago, in a country called Persia (Babylon), there was a king named
          Achashveyrosh (as known in Jewish... His Persian name was Xerxes) and
          a queen named Vashti. King Achashveyrosh ordered his wife the queen to
          appear before him at a party so he could show everyone how pretty she
          was. When she refused, the king was furious. To make matters worse, a
          rather nasty man named Haman was one of the King's advisors. Haman
          teased the king that if word got around, no one's wife would think she
          had to listen to her husband. At Haman's urging, King Achashveyrosh
          ordered that his wife be put to death. King Achashveyrosh wasn't happy
          for long without a queen, so he ordered a search through the kingdom
          for a beautiful girl to be his bride. It wasn't too long before the
          King's scouts happened upon Esther. Esther was beautiful, gracious and
          kind -- just what the king was looking for. In no time at all, Esther
          was married to the king. Now Esther was a Jew. The Jews had been
          driven out of Israel, their home, about 70 years before and exiled in
          Persia. Although they did there best to make a living in this strange
          land, they prayed that someday they would be able to return to their
          home. Esther's uncle Mordechai, was the leader of the Jews. Mordechai
          encouraged Esther to hide her faith from the King and his advisors,
          which she did. Haman had, by this time, become a powerful man in the
          kingdom - Prime Minister of Persia in fact. He decided that given his
          rise in power, it would be appropriate for everyone to bow down to
          him. But Mordechai refused to bow down to him. Haman was very angry
          and asked the King to authorize a royal decree to annihilate the Jews.
          Haman cast lots to determine the day this was to happen. And so it was
          decreed that in Adar of the coming year, on the 13th day of the month,
          all the Jews were to be killed, in every province and every nation of
          the land. There would be no place to run, and no place to hide. This
          is where our brave Queen Esther comes into the picture -- Mordechai,
          having found out about Haman's evil intentions, sent Esther a message.
          He told her what Haman was plotting and asked her to go to the King on
          the Jews behalf. Esther was afraid. She hadn't been allowed to see the
          King for a month. In fact, no one could see him without being invited.
          But she fasted and prayed for three days, mustered up her courage and
          went to see the king. Although he was initially angry at her, King
          Achashveyrosh spared her life and offered "half my kingdom for your
          wishes," All she asked was that the King and Haman join her for dinner
          that night. As they were drinking wine, the king again asked Esther,
          "Now what is your request? Even up to half the kingdom, it will be
          granted." Esther replied, "My petition and my request is this: If the
          king regards me with favor and if it pleases the king to grant my
          petition and fulfill my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow
          to the banquet I will prepare for them. Then I will answer the king's
          question." Of course, both the King and Haman agreed to attend a
          second banquet with the lovely young Queen. Haman was very pleased
          that he'd been asked to dine with Achashveyrosh and Esther two nights
          in a row and was filled with pride. But then he saw Mordecai at the
          king's gate and still Mordecai refused to bow to him. Haman was filled
          with rage. He decided that night to build a gallows with which to hang
          Mordechai and planned to speak to the king about it the very next
          morning. That way, he'd have the whole matter dealt with during the
          day and be able to enjoy the next evening's banquet in peace. That
          same night the king could not sleep; so he ordered the book of the
          chronicles, the record of his reign, to be brought in and read to him.
          The book was turned to the day Mordecai exposed a plot to assassinate
          the King. The King was reminded of this tale and asked what reward
          Mordecai had received. The king's attendants told him that nothing had
          been done for Mordecai. The next morning, just as Haman was arriving
          to ask that Mordecai be hanged the king asked him, "What should be
          done for the man the king delights to honor?" Haman, still filled with
          pride, mistakenly thought the king was referring to him. So he
          answered the king, "For the man the king delights to honor, have them
          bring a royal robe the king has worn and a horse the king has ridden,
          one with a royal crest placed on its head. Then let the robe and horse
          be entrusted to one of the king's most noble princes. Let them robe
          the man the king delights to honor, and lead him on the horse through
          the city streets, proclaiming before him, `This is what is done for
          the man the king delights to honor!'" Imagine Haman's shock when the
          King commanded, "Go at once. Get the robe and the horse and do just as
          you have suggested for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the king's gate."
          Haman obeyed the king, of course, but not happily! He was very upset
          that Mordecai, his enemy, was being honored by the king. Immediately
          after leading Mordecai around the city proclaiming, "This is what is
          done for the man the king delights to honor!", Haman had to go to the
          banquet with the King and Queen. Finally Esther shared the secret of
          her faith and proclaimed herself a Jew. She begged the king to spare
          her people. Harbona, one of the king's attendants told the king of the
          gallows that Haman had built to have Mordecai hanged. The king was
          furious with Haman and ordered that he be hanged on those gallows.
          Haman's pride and cruelty had led to his own destruction and the
          brave, young Esther had saved her people.

        <h3>The story of Ruth</h3>
        <p>
          In a place called Moab there lived a nice family. Elimelech, his wife
          Naomi and their two sons moved there because there was more food there
          than where they used to live. After a while Elimelech died but Naomi
          wasn't alone she still had two sons. Her sons got married but after
          about ten years they died too. At least Naomi still had her sons wives
          to keep her company, their names were Orpah and Ruth. Naomi called her
          sons wives and told them, "I am going to go back to where I used to
          live and I would like you also to go back to your family where you
          used to live. May God show you kindness as you have showed me." All
          the women cried and hugged each other because they were such good
          friends. Orpah didn't want to leave Naomi but Naomi told her not to
          worry, she would be fine. So Orpah left to go back to her family. But
          no matter what Naomi said to Ruth, Ruth would not leave. "Don't ask me
          to leave. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your
          friends will be my friends and your God will be my God." So Ruth and
          Naomi returned to Bethlehem together. It was a good thing Ruth went
          with Naomi because Bethlehem was very far away and Naomi couldn't have
          traveled all that way by herself. Notice that Ruth never complains but
          is a good friend to Naomi. She wasn't expecting anything in return,
          she just wanted to help. children's bible storiesWhen they got there
          Ruth decided that she should do some kind of work. It was harvest
          time, so she worked in the fields following behind the harvesters and
          picked up any barley that they had dropped. The owner of the field
          came by to greet the harvesters and noticed Ruth in the field. He
          asked one of the harvesters who she was. "She came back from Moab with
          Naomi, that's all I know." Lucky for Ruth the owner of the field was
          Boaz, he was a kind man who believed in God. He had also been related
          to Elimelech (Naomi's husband that died). Boaz went to go talk to
          Ruth, he said to her, "Don't go work in any other field but stay here
          with the other servant girls. I will make sure you are safe and
          whenever you are thirsty go and get a drink from the water jars." When
          Ruth heard this she bowed down to Boaz and asked, "Why are you being
          so nice to me, I'm not even from here." Boaz replied, "I know what
          you've done for Naomi, you left your family and moved to a place
          you've never been. May the Lord reward you for your kindness." Ruth
          thanked Boaz and continued with her work in the hot sun. Boaz even
          ordered his workers to drop extra barley so Ruth could have more for
          herself. Ruth took all the barley home and shared what she had with
          Naomi. And eventually Ruth married Boaz and everyone was very happy! *
          Being a good friend takes a long time to learn. A good friend is
          loyal, which means you keep your promises and sometimes when you don't
          feel like being a friend you are anyway. Sometimes our friends aren't
          perfect and they make mistakes but we make mistakes too, and we don't
          want our friends to leave us when that happens. God gives us friends
          when we need them, and we should treat them like a gift from God. Just
          like in the story, Naomi could've insisted the women come with her,
          but she unselfish and wanted them to be free to go home to be with
          their families. And Ruth had such a good attitude and wanted to help,
          she moved away from everyone she knew and went to work to help Naomi.
          She didn't tell everyone what a good friend she was, she knew that she
          should be a friend like God wanted her to be.
