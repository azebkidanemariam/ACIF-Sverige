    title: "Who is Jesus? Is Jesus God or Son of God?",
    content: `Jesus inquired of His disciples about the public's perception of His identity. Some believed He was Elijah, others thought He was Jeremiah, and some even suggested He was John the Baptist. Following this, Jesus asked His disciples directly who they believed He was. Peter, through divine revelation, proclaimed that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.

    Matthew 16:16 (KJV) And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.
    
    If we go back to the moment when the Angel Gabriel spoke to Mary, the words conveyed that the one to be born from her would be the Son of God.
    
    Luke 1:35 (KJV) And the angel answered and said unto her, The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.
    
    Joseph, through a dream by the Angel, was also informed that the child, conceived by the Holy Ghost, would be named Jesus, fulfilling the prophecy given by Isaiah 700 years prior.
    
    Matthew 1:20-23 (KJV) 20 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. 21 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins. 22 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying, 23 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
    
    Isaiah not only reveals that the child to be born is a son but also describes Him as the mighty God and Father of eternity. This significance is reflected in the name "Emanuel," signifying "God with us."
    
    Isaiah 9:6 (KJV) For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.
    
    The confirmation of this is evident in various instances when Jesus walked on earth. For instance, Philip, desiring to see the Father, inquired about Him. In response, Jesus, the one being asked, reaffirmed the truth foretold by Isaiah in chapter 9, verse 6. Rather than guiding Philip to another figure, the Lord emphasized that He, Himself is not only the Son but also the Father.
    
    John 14:8-9 (KJV) 8 Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. 9 Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? he that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou [then], Shew us the Father?
    
    Another notable instance occurred when Jesus was requested to show His pierced side and nailed hands. It was through this revelation that Thomas ultimately reached the conclusion that Jesus is both Lord and God.
    
    John 20:28 (KJV) And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
    
    By linking these truths, we are brought back to an Old Testament truth of One God who is the Father.
    
    Malachi 2:10 (KJV) Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?
    
    Indeed, Jesus is the Son of God, the Christ, and simultaneously, He is the One God Himself, who is the Father.`,

    title: "What is the true meaning of repentance?",
    content: `Repentance is a profound act of acknowledging one's wrongdoings, accompanied by a sincere desire for change and a commitment to rectify past mistakes. It involves remorse for actions or decisions that have caused harm, whether to oneself or others. Central to many spiritual and moral traditions, repentance signifies an inner transformation, urging individuals to reflect on their behavior, take responsibility, and seek forgiveness. It's a process that demands humility, introspection, and the determination to make amends, leading to personal growth, reconciliation, and a renewed sense of integrity!`,
    verse: ` Acts 3:19 (New International Version) - "Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord."`,

    title: "What is baptism?",
    content:
      "Baptism is a religious ritual symbolizing purification, initiation, or admission into the Christian faith through the application of water, representing spiritual cleansing and rebirth.",
    verse: `Matthew 28:19-20 (New International Version) - "Therefore go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age."\n\nActs 2:38 (New International Version) - "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.'"`,

    title: "Is Jesus God or Man?",
    content: `Jesus is both God and man. However, He is not the first man but the last man (1 Corinthians 15:42), distinguishing Him from the nature of Adam. As God, He is the creator; as man, He is not created but the Word made flesh (John 1:4), God manifested in flesh (1 Timothy 3:16). He died as a man and raised Himself as God (John 2:19). He is referred to as both man and the Son of God only when He was manifested in the flesh (Luke 1:35). Subsequently, He continued to reveal His divinity through His body, in whom dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily (Colossians 2:9). This is why, when Philip sought to see the Father, Jesus directed him to Himself (John 14:9). He remains God and man, Father and Son, even now in heaven (Isaiah 9:6; Revelation 22:3).`,

    title: "When does the new testement church stabilished?",
    content: `The New Testament church is established on the day of Pentecost fifty days after the resurrection of Jesus.

    The Lord had told the apostles, especially Peter, that He would build the church.
    
    Matthew 16:18 (KJV) And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
    
    In connection with this, the Lord promised to give Peter the keys of the kingdom of heaven.
    
    Matthew 16:19 (KJV) And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
    
    This is not just a promise to one individual, Peter, but also to all those who adhere to the teachings of the Lord.
    
    Luke 10:16 (KJV) He that heareth you heareth me; and he that despiseth you despiseth me; and he that despiseth me despiseth him that sent me.
    
    The Lord reaffirmed this fact after His resurrection.
    
    John 20:23 (KJV) Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; [and] whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.
    
    Following that, the Lord commanded them to wait in Jerusalem until they were filled with the power of the Holy Spirit.
    
    Acts 1:8 (KJV) But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
    
    When the Holy Spirit was poured out, Peter stood among the apostles and preached the gospel to people who had gathered in Jerusalem from all over the world to celebrate Pentecost. During his preaching, they were pricked at heart and asked him what they must do. This led him to preach to them about repentance and remission of sins, as was prophesied to start in Jerusalem.
    
    Luke 24:47 (KJV) And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
    
    Acts 2:37-38 (KJV) 37 Now when they heard [this], they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men [and] brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
    
    This is how Peter makes use of the keys that he received from the Lord, through which the Lord is building His church. We see it being fulfilled first on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem.
    
    This is how, where and when the New Testament church was established.`,
