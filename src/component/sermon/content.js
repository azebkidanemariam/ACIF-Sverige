 In the battleground of life, amidst the intense spiritual warfare, the adversary constantly seeks to deceive, exploiting vulnerabilities in both strength and weakness. The Apostle Paul warns us about the cunning schemes of the devil, urging believers to stand firm against the wiles of the adversary (Ephesians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 2:11). Satan, known as the deceiver, masquerades as an angel of light, making discernment crucial (2 Corinthians 11:14). He subtly whispers lies to confuse and distract, aiming to undermine the work of God.

The scripture emphasizes the need for spiritual vigilance, urging believers to be watchful and alert. The enemy, like a roaring lion, seeks whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). Therefore, believers must resist the devil and stand firm in the faith (James 4:7). The spiritual battle involves recognizing the enemy's tactics and engaging in the armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18).

In the midst of this struggle, believers are called to be separate from the world, not conforming to its patterns but rather transforming through the renewing of the mind (Romans 12:2). The Church, as the body of Christ, is called to be a peculiar people, set apart for God's purposes (1 Peter 2:9). Discernment and adherence to biblical truths are essential for navigating the complexities of the spiritual battlefield.

The Apostle John warns against false prophets and teaches that believers have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, enabling them to discern between truth and error (1 John 2:20, 27). The Church, as the pillar and foundation of the truth, plays a crucial role in upholding sound doctrine (1 Timothy 3:15).

Ultimately, believers find strength in Christ, the captain of their salvation. By abiding in Him and relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they can overcome the tactics of the enemy. The Church, empowered by the Word of God, stands as a beacon of light in a dark world, proclaiming the victory found in Christ.

  Matthew 9:14-17 (KJV) 14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. 17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

  John's disciples and the Pharisees are still fasting.
  
  However, the Lord is conveying that the friend of the bridegroom doesn't have to fast when the bridegroom is present.
  
  Whose friends do they reveal themselves to be through their practice of fasting while Jesus is yet with them?
  
  It's clear to whom the Pharisees belong. They deviated so far from God's path that the Lord had to address their hypocrisy. He points out their deficiency in understanding the word of God, and even when they search for it, they refuse to come to Him, despite the word speaking about Him. Hence, their allegiance must be to someone or something else.
  
  What has transpired with John the Baptist's disciples? Why don't they sense a connection as friends of the bridegroom at hand?
  
  Could the church falter in equipping its members to be friends of the bridegroom? Might the members ultimately become friends of someone else?
  
  2 Corinthians 11:2-3 (KJV) 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ. 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
  
  Despite John sending his disciples to ask if Jesus is the awaited one during his imprisonment, he had previously rejoiced upon learning that Jesus was baptizing, expressing the following sentiment.
  
  John 3:29 (KJV) He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
  
  His disciples struggled to comprehend what the Baptist aimed to reveal about the Lord. Even in Acts chapter 19, after a considerable time, they still seemed to lack the understanding that John was striving to convey.
  
  Prior to the revelation of the Lord, John observed fasting while fulfilling his role in preparing the way.
  
  Matthew 11:18 (KJV) For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
  
  Fasting is a means through which we seek the revelation and presence of the Lord.
  
  The Lord affirmed His identity as the bridegroom through the act of feeding a multitude. Indeed, this bridegroom is the God of the Old Testament who is known as the husband of Israel. The feeding of the multitude provides a sneak preview of what is to come.
  
  Revelation 7:15-17 (KJV) 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
  
  (Isa 54:5; Hos 2:19,20; Rev 21:9; 19:7)
  
  â€¦ They shall fast when the bridegroom shall be taken from them.
  
  Following Jesus' ascension, the disciples prayed for 10 days, most likely including fasting, as true friends were expected to fast when the bridegroom is taken. On the tenth day, the Holy Spirit descended upon them.
  
  Fasting serves the purpose of experiencing the presence of the bridegroom in His absence, and it's important to understand that the descended Holy Spirit is, in fact, the Lord Himself.
  
  2 Corinthians 3:17 (KJV) Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
  
  Through fasting, we seek to experience the presence of the Lord more intensely than at other times. We longingly search for Him, especially when He seems distant.
  
  Those who fast while the Lord is present among them might lack a true understanding of Him or could be fasting for reasons other than seeking His presence.
  
  John 1:9-10 (KJV) 9 [That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
  
  If they truly knew Him, they would have found joy in His presence.
  
  Fasting in His absence reflects our hunger for Him, while fasting in His presence may indicate a hunger for something else, akin to those who asked Jesus for manna, not recognizing that He is the true manna from heaven.
  
  If the Pharisees' true joy was in Jesus Himself, they would have found delight in His presence. Those described as reluctant to come to the Lord likely harbor different desires. To remain joyless and saddened in His presence shows a search for something else.
  
  The Pharisees' hunger was rooted in their love for religiosity. True Biblical fasting, however, is when we passionately crave the Lord Himself, earnestly crying out to find and long for His presence.
  
  Psalms 42:1-3 (KJV) 1 [[To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.]] As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where [is] thy God?

export const sermon3Content = `In the grand tapestry of God's plan, a divine moment beckons us to rise and join hands as co-laborers. The time for the bountiful harvest has arrived, and the Almighty, the unstoppable force, is at work. When He moves, no opposition can thwart His purpose (Jehemiah 4:35, Zechariah 2:13).

  Acknowledging God's rise to action in opening the doors of the gospel to the church doesn't shield us from opposition. Yet, our focus remains unwavering, fixed on the One who has risen to work (1 Corinthians 16:9, Revelation 3:7-8). The Bible unfolds narratives where, in David's era, he aspired to build God's house, but God deferred the task to his future offspring. Conversely, during Haggai's time, though the need to build God's house was apparent, people were preoccupied with personal affairs until God revived their spirits (1 Samuel 14:6-15, Haggai 1:1-15).
  
  In the season of God's divine labor:
  
  We are entrusted with giving what we have received, especially the precious gift of salvation. Our calling is to share the secrets of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 13:11, 1 Corinthians 4:7, Luke 12:48).
  God's work requires willing ministers and devoted people. History shows that when Nehemiah rose to rebuild Jerusalem's walls, the people rallied with him (Judges 5:1-2, Nehemiah 2:17-18).
  As we align ourselves with the work of the gospel, akin to Elijah recognizing the small cloud signaling rain, we must believe in God's impending work. Our involvement in the gospel becomes a gateway to sharing in its abundant blessings (1 Corinthians 9:23).
  
  May our collective efforts be a testament to our participation in the divine blessings that unfold when God initiates His work.`;
export const sermon4Content = `John 4:24 (KJV) God [is] a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship [him] in spirit and in truth.

  Worshipping God in truth and spirit involves a deep, internal connection with Him. It goes beyond external rituals and material aspects. When Jesus spoke to the Samaritan woman, He emphasized that God is a spirit and true worshippers are not restricted to a certain mountain.
  
  Worshipping in truth requires knowing God intimately. The Bible teaches that understanding God precedes genuine worship.
  
  Isaiah 43:10 (KJV) Ye [are] my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I [am] he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.
  
  It also stresses the importance of authentic worship, warning against mere outward forms without acknowledging God's power.
  
  2 Timothy 3:5 (KJV) Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.
  
  Harmonious coexistence with neighbors hinges on understanding their behavior, mirroring the importance of comprehending God's character in our relationship with Him to avoid causing offense. The wisdom from the Book of Malachi underscores the value of presenting genuine and wholehearted worship to God.
  
  Malachi 1:6-8 (KJV) 6 A son honoureth [his] father, and a servant his master: if then I [be] a father, where [is] mine honour? and if I [be] a master, where [is] my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests, that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy name? 7 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD [is] contemptible. 8 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, [is it] not evil? and if ye offer the lame and sick, [is it] not evil? offer it now unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy person? saith the LORD of hosts.
  
  Without knowledge of God, our offerings will not be accepted. True worship involves not just the external elements but the condition of our hearts and minds. Transformation through knowledge of God is essential for genuine worship.
  
  God is Love
  
  Cain and Abel's story highlights God's favor toward Abel's sacrificial offering, reflecting Abel's sincere heart. In contrast, Cain's jealousy and improper conduct reveal a lack of genuine worship. True worship involves transforming into God's image, embodying His love. Understanding that God is love is essential, and expressing that love is the core of genuine worship. Cain's failure to demonstrate love together with his sacrifice makes his worship inadequate, as John cautioned against following Cain's example when describing God's attribute of love.
  
  1 John 3:12 (KJV) Not as Cain, [who] was of that wicked one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous.
  1 John 3:15 (KJV) Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.
  
  1 John 4:8 (KJV) He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.
  
  God is Merciful
  
  True worship involves grasping God's character, acknowledging His love, and embracing His mercy. God prioritizes mercy over mere sacrifices, underscoring the importance of forgiveness towards others. The Lord's Prayer emphasizes seeking and granting forgiveness, aligning our hearts with God's merciful essence. Without this, authentic worship in truth remains incomplete.
  
  Hosea 6:6 (KJV) For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
  
  In essence, worshipping God in truth and spirit involves an intimate understanding of God, transformation into His image through love and mercy, and sincere, heartfelt worship that goes beyond external rituals.
  
  Knowing God transcends mere intellectual understanding; it entails a transformation that shapes our character, making us more like Him.
  
  God is Omnipresent
  
  Another attribute of God is His omnipresence, a concept vividly depicted by David in Psalm 139. Despite this, when the prophet Jonah was sent to Nineveh, he attempted to escape from God's presence by boarding a ship bound for Tarshish, the farthest west part of the old world. In this act, Jonah overlooked God's omnipresence. When questioned by the people on the boat, Jonah professed he is a worshiper of the One who created the sea and the dry land. However, despite possessing this knowledge, Jonah failed to align his actions with it.
  
  God, being omnipresent, orchestrated an event where Jonah was swallowed by a whale, an experience that ultimately led him back to Nineveh. Despite Jonah's initial failure in worship, God's omnipresence accompanied him through the depths. Subsequently, Jonah prayed from the depths, and God heard his prayer, rescuing him and allowing him to fulfill his mission in Nineveh, where the entire city repented. This narrative illustrates the profound impact of truly worshiping in alignment with the knowledge of God's attributes.
  
  God is Omniscient
  
  The Book of Acts, Chapter 5, reveals God's omniscience through the account of Hananiah and Sapphira. As believers contributed to the church, the couple sold their possession but deceptively held back part of the proceeds when presenting it to Peter. Despite asserting it was the full amount, Peter, who had acknowledged the Lord Jesus's omniscience when questioned about his love, confronted them for attempting to deceive the Holy Spirit. Their dishonesty resulted in the severe consequence of both individuals facing death.
  
  John 21:17 (KJV) He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of Jonas, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
  
  The lesson here is that while we worship God by offering our substances, it is crucial to do so with a proper understanding of God's characters, such as His omniscience. Hananiah and Sapphira's failure to worship with this knowledge, evidenced by their deceitful actions, resulted in severe consequences. Genuine worship brings blessings, but distorted motives in worship may lead to negative outcomes.
  
  The couple's motive, pretending to offer their entire proceeds while secretly holding back, suggests a desire for recognition and respect. This form of worship, driven by improper motives, does not align with the true essence of worshiping God.
  
  God is Omnipotent
  
  The narrative of Uzzah in 2 Samuel Chapter 6 serves as a lesson on the proper way to worship the Lord by understanding His attributes. Uzzah attempted to steady the ark of the covenant during its transportation to the city of David, but the story teaches us that we cannot "assist" God because He is omnipotent; He doesn't require our help. Paul in the book of Acts chapter 17 emphasizes that the Lord, the Creator of heavens and Earth, doesn't depend on human hands for service, as illustrated by Uzzah's tragic death.
  
  Acts 17:25 (KJV) Neither is worshipped with men's hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
  
  Worshiping God according to His explicit word
  
  David, saddened by Uzzah's demise, sought guidance through prayer and fasting. In this process, he discovered from the Book of the Law that the ark of the covenant should only be transported by the shoulders of priests. Adhering to the proper guidelines, David successfully brought the ark to his city.
  
  The lesson derived is that worshiping God should follow the guidelines outlined in the Bible. We cannot worship God arbitrarily; there are specific principles and practices to be observed in alignment with His revealed truths.
  
  Psalms 138:2 (KJV) I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name.
  
  When Elijah confronted the prophets of Baal on Mount Carmel, he prayed to God, saying, "Lord, this I do according to your word, so answer by fire." The Lord indeed answered by fire, illustrating the importance of worshiping God, making sacrifices, and offering according to His word. This practice is not arbitrary; even earlier, Elijah had prayed for God to close the heavens, withholding rain for three years. His actions were grounded in Deuteronomy 28, where God had warned Israel of consequences, including a lack of rain, if they didn't worship Him according to His word.
  
  1 Kings 18:36 (KJV) And it came to pass at [the time of] the offering of the [evening] sacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou [art] God in Israel, and [that] I [am] thy servant, and [that] I have done all these things at thy word.
  
  In contrast, the story of Saul in 1 Samuel 15 presents an opposite scenario. Saul was instructed to destroy all the Amalekites, but he spared their king and some valuable animals, deviating from God's command. Samuel rebuked Saul, and God declared that Saul's kingdom would be taken away because he didn't respect God's word; he wanted to worship in his own way. This serves as a stark reminder that true worship adheres to God's truth and commands.
  
  David, who succeeded Saul, demonstrated genuine worship. In Psalm 50, he acknowledged that all the animals on the mountains belong to the Lord. In psalm 51 he said they can only be sacrificed when the Lord asks for it. This emphasizes that sacrifices are only meaningful when offered according to God's orders and in alignment with His word.
  
  Abraham's life also showcases this principle from both angles. Initially he asked God to consider Eliezer as his heir, he later presented Ishmael before Him. However, God insisted that the true inheritor would be born from Abraham and Sarah. Eventually, Isaac was born. Then God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham obeyed, this time demonstrating true worship. God intervened, recognizing Abraham's fear of God and obedience.
  
  Genesis 22:12 (KJV) And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only [son] from me.
  
  In essence, the narratives emphasize that genuine worship involves obedience to God's word, making sacrifices as directed by Him, and respecting His divine commands. Arbitrary or self-fashioned worship, as demonstrated by Saul, contrasts with the sincere and obedient worship exemplified by Elijah, David, and Abraham.
  
  God is Holy
  
  In 2 Kings Chapter 17, there is an account of people from various nations, brought by Assyria to the city of Samaria, who were killed by lions because they lacked knowledge of how to live in the holy land. It was for similar reason that the Israelites were expelled from the land. God's holiness persisted for the land. Therefore, it was needed for an Israelite priest to come from an exile and teach these new people about the manner of the God of the land so that they will not be devoured by the lions. This emphases the importance of understanding and adhering to the law of God and His holiness.
  
  When Isaiah beheld the manifestation of the Holy God, he exclaimed, "Woe unto me!" Repentant for his unclean leaps, this highlights the sobering realization of standing before God without due regard for His holiness.
  
  Exodus Chapter 19 directed the Israelites to wash their clothes and be clean before meeting God, underlining the significance of purity in approaching the Lord. Psalm 15 further outlines the characteristics of those who can dwell in the mountain of the Lord, highlighting the importance of purity and integrity.
  
  David, in Psalm 141, illustrates his commitment to guard his lips against speaking harmful words, while Job, in Job Chapter 31, describes how he safeguarded his eyes from inappropriate sights. These examples serve as illustrations of the necessity of purity in the sight of the Lord before engaging in worship.
  
  Given that God is holy, these instances emphasize the need to worship Him with a heart and life marked by holiness. Understanding and embodying God's standards of purity are crucial elements in approaching Him in worship.`;
