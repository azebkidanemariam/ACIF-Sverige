 In the battleground of life, amidst the intense spiritual warfare, the adversary constantly seeks to deceive, exploiting vulnerabilities in both strength and weakness. The Apostle Paul warns us about the cunning schemes of the devil, urging believers to stand firm against the wiles of the adversary (Ephesians 6:11; 2 Corinthians 2:11). Satan, known as the deceiver, masquerades as an angel of light, making discernment crucial (2 Corinthians 11:14). He subtly whispers lies to confuse and distract, aiming to undermine the work of God.

The scripture emphasizes the need for spiritual vigilance, urging believers to be watchful and alert. The enemy, like a roaring lion, seeks whom he may devour (1 Peter 5:8). Therefore, believers must resist the devil and stand firm in the faith (James 4:7). The spiritual battle involves recognizing the enemy's tactics and engaging in the armor of God (Ephesians 6:10-18).

In the midst of this struggle, believers are called to be separate from the world, not conforming to its patterns but rather transforming through the renewing of the mind (Romans 12:2). The Church, as the body of Christ, is called to be a peculiar people, set apart for God's purposes (1 Peter 2:9). Discernment and adherence to biblical truths are essential for navigating the complexities of the spiritual battlefield.

The Apostle John warns against false prophets and teaches that believers have received the anointing of the Holy Spirit, enabling them to discern between truth and error (1 John 2:20, 27). The Church, as the pillar and foundation of the truth, plays a crucial role in upholding sound doctrine (1 Timothy 3:15).

Ultimately, believers find strength in Christ, the captain of their salvation. By abiding in Him and relying on the guidance of the Holy Spirit, they can overcome the tactics of the enemy. The Church, empowered by the Word of God, stands as a beacon of light in a dark world, proclaiming the victory found in Christ.

  Matthew 9:14-17 (KJV) 14 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not? 15 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then shall they fast. 16 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment, and the rent is made worse. 17 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

  John's disciples and the Pharisees are still fasting.
  
  However, the Lord is conveying that the friend of the bridegroom doesn't have to fast when the bridegroom is present.
  
  Whose friends do they reveal themselves to be through their practice of fasting while Jesus is yet with them?
  
  It's clear to whom the Pharisees belong. They deviated so far from God's path that the Lord had to address their hypocrisy. He points out their deficiency in understanding the word of God, and even when they search for it, they refuse to come to Him, despite the word speaking about Him. Hence, their allegiance must be to someone or something else.
  
  What has transpired with John the Baptist's disciples? Why don't they sense a connection as friends of the bridegroom at hand?
  
  Could the church falter in equipping its members to be friends of the bridegroom? Might the members ultimately become friends of someone else?
  
  2 Corinthians 11:2-3 (KJV) 2 For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present [you as] a chaste virgin to Christ. 3 But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.
  
  Despite John sending his disciples to ask if Jesus is the awaited one during his imprisonment, he had previously rejoiced upon learning that Jesus was baptizing, expressing the following sentiment.
  
  John 3:29 (KJV) He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled.
  
  His disciples struggled to comprehend what the Baptist aimed to reveal about the Lord. Even in Acts chapter 19, after a considerable time, they still seemed to lack the understanding that John was striving to convey.
  
  Prior to the revelation of the Lord, John observed fasting while fulfilling his role in preparing the way.
  
  Matthew 11:18 (KJV) For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a devil.
  
  Fasting is a means through which we seek the revelation and presence of the Lord.
  
  The Lord affirmed His identity as the bridegroom through the act of feeding a multitude. Indeed, this bridegroom is the God of the Old Testament who is known as the husband of Israel. The feeding of the multitude provides a sneak preview of what is to come.
  
  Revelation 7:15-17 (KJV) 15 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them. 16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat. 17 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.
  
  (Isa 54:5; Hos 2:19,20; Rev 21:9; 19:7)
  
  â€¦ They shall fast when the bridegroom shall be taken from them.
  
  Following Jesus' ascension, the disciples prayed for 10 days, most likely including fasting, as true friends were expected to fast when the bridegroom is taken. On the tenth day, the Holy Spirit descended upon them.
  
  Fasting serves the purpose of experiencing the presence of the bridegroom in His absence, and it's important to understand that the descended Holy Spirit is, in fact, the Lord Himself.
  
  2 Corinthians 3:17 (KJV) Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there [is] liberty.
  
  Through fasting, we seek to experience the presence of the Lord more intensely than at other times. We longingly search for Him, especially when He seems distant.
  
  Those who fast while the Lord is present among them might lack a true understanding of Him or could be fasting for reasons other than seeking His presence.
  
  John 1:9-10 (KJV) 9 [That] was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. 10 He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.
  
  If they truly knew Him, they would have found joy in His presence.
  
  Fasting in His absence reflects our hunger for Him, while fasting in His presence may indicate a hunger for something else, akin to those who asked Jesus for manna, not recognizing that He is the true manna from heaven.
  
  If the Pharisees' true joy was in Jesus Himself, they would have found delight in His presence. Those described as reluctant to come to the Lord likely harbor different desires. To remain joyless and saddened in His presence shows a search for something else.
  
  The Pharisees' hunger was rooted in their love for religiosity. True Biblical fasting, however, is when we passionately crave the Lord Himself, earnestly crying out to find and long for His presence.
  
  Psalms 42:1-3 (KJV) 1 [[To the chief Musician, Maschil, for the sons of Korah.]] As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God. 2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God? 3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where [is] thy God?

  const sermon3Content = `In the grand tapestry of God's plan, a divine moment beckons us to rise and join hands as co-laborers. The time for the bountiful harvest has arrived, and the Almighty, the unstoppable force, is at work. When He moves, no opposition can thwart His purpose (Jehemiah 4:35, Zechariah 2:13).

  Acknowledging God's rise to action in opening the doors of the gospel to the church doesn't shield us from opposition. Yet, our focus remains unwavering, fixed on the One who has risen to work (1 Corinthians 16:9, Revelation 3:7-8). The Bible unfolds narratives where, in David's era, he aspired to build God's house, but God deferred the task to his future offspring. Conversely, during Haggai's time, though the need to build God's house was apparent, people were preoccupied with personal affairs until God revived their spirits (1 Samuel 14:6-15, Haggai 1:1-15).
  
  In the season of God's divine labor:
  
  We are entrusted with giving what we have received, especially the precious gift of salvation. Our calling is to share the secrets of the kingdom of heaven (Matthew 13:11, 1 Corinthians 4:7, Luke 12:48).
  God's work requires willing ministers and devoted people. History shows that when Nehemiah rose to rebuild Jerusalem's walls, the people rallied with him (Judges 5:1-2, Nehemiah 2:17-18).
  As we align ourselves with the work of the gospel, akin to Elijah recognizing the small cloud signaling rain, we must believe in God's impending work. Our involvement in the gospel becomes a gateway to sharing in its abundant blessings (1 Corinthians 9:23).
  
  May our collective efforts be a testament to our participation in the divine blessings that unfold when God initiates His work.`;
